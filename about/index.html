        <h2>About the creator</h2>
        <p>
            Keaton Carter was born and raised in Utah. At a young age he found employment
            through his neighbors mowing their lawns and cleaning their window seals.
            That is when he transitioned to window cleaning. All of his neighbors told him
            that they were impressed with his work and that it doesn't seem like were a lot
            window cleaning companies that were affordable. That's when Keaton got his idea.
